    <p>Hello everyone! Let me share a bit about me. I live in the city of La Paz Bolivia
        I'm married and have a little daughter. In La Paz the weather is nice during most
        of the year. La Paz is a city full of touristic attractions and landscapes. Some
        examples are the Illimani snowy mountain along with the Real Mountain Range and
        "El Valle de La Luna"</p>

        <p>I recently became a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
            I do appreciate all the love, guidance and teachings I have received from our Lord,
            the church, the missionaries, and other church members.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as an independent consultant for an outsourcing company. I love computers
            and my dream is to have deeper knowledge of technology to change my life and have a positive
            impact in the life of people around me especially inside my community and family.</p>
            <p>I enjoy social networks, watching videos, and computer games. Thank you for visiting
               web page, have a wonderful semester!
            </p>
